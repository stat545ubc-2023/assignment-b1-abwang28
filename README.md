# Alex Wang Assignment B1
This repository is for Alex Wang's STAT 545 Assignment B1. For this assignment, I am practicing making, documenting, and testing a function in R.

The work for the assignment lies within the AW-Assignment-B1 files. In the AW-Assignment-B1.rmd file, I created my function (named group_count_prop), documented it, gave examples of its usage, and tested it. The AW-Assignment-B1.md file is the knitted output markdown file of AW-Assignment-B1.rmd.

Code in this repository is written in R and can be run in RStudio. R and RStudio are required to execute the RMarkdown files present. To execute the files, you may locally clone/download the repository, open the RMarkdown files in RStudio, install the required packages (tidyverse, testthat, palmerpenguins, datateachr, and roxygen2) if needed, and click 'knit' to knit the document to an md file.
